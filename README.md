# Middle-East-Dry-Fruits-Company-Project-case-study-
this repository contains a Power BI case study that analyzes the sales data of the Middle East Dry Fruits Company. The project provides valuable insights into sales performance across different regions, sales teams, and individual salespeople. This analysis helps guide strategic decisions to improve revenue and optimize team efficiency.
# BUSINESS TASK
The main objective is to analyze sales performance by:
- region
- salesperson
- product type
  
The company aims to understand which regions and salespeople contribute most to revenue, as well as identify areas for improvement within its sales teams. This analysis will help drive better business decisions to boost overall sales performance.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation
Several data cleaning steps were performed before the analysis:

1. Data Modeling:
   - Standardized the column names by modeling the "Geography" and "Geo" columns to ensure consistency in regional data across all records

2. Trimming Unnecessary Spaces:
   - Used the TRIM function to remove any leading or trailing spaces from text fields, ensuring the data is clean and ready for analysis.

3. Team Allocation for Unassigned Salespeople:
   - Identified salespeople who were not allocated to any team. Used the Replace Value function to assign these salespeople to a "Special Team" to ensure they are included 
     in the analysis.

4. Adding a Profit Column:
   - Created an additional column to calculate profit by using the difference between revenue (Amount) and cost. This new column was added to the data table to provide 
     insights into profitability.
